# Banking tech test

- I am writing this in Javascript to get better while improving my process
- I will be doing semantic commit messages

## Testing
- I need to decide what testing framework I will use


## How to run the code
- Open main.js file in chrome
- Open Chrome console


## Requirements
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

> The output of balance printing should look like this

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
